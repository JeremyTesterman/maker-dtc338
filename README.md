Course Description
This course is an undergraduate-level “hands-on” introduction to Maker Culture. It is a makers’ workshop, a design lab, and a creative-programming studio, intended to provide a supporting framework for students’ research and development as they build ambitious projects of their own design.  Class meetings will include on-going discussion of the full meaning of being a “maker” today.  “Making” will be considered from a variety of historical and cultural vantage points, and examples will be sought that highlight different priorities and standards vouchsafed in “making” and its products.  One point of interest will be the cultural and semiotic range of interpretive possibilities that emerges with “maker” objects and practices, and we will reflect on how the Maker Movement responds to these.  We will pursue a critical perspective and cite specific examples of technologies, projects and developments that illustrate the contours and historical trajectories of “making.”  The course will also encourage students to articulate the conceptual and material contexts of their own work and to address the considerations of launching projects in social, online, hybrid and physical spaces of engagement.  This class will generate a shared research dialogue and space within which to pursue creative work that is conceptual and technical, and it is preeminently a place for students to ask questions, seek guidance and exchange ideas.  Course meetings will consist of a combination of class work, group “critiques,” roundtable discussion, 5-minute presentations, design thinking exercises, and focused topic-and-tool-specific workshops. 

Because this course takes a “hands-on” approach to material and digital practices, it is ideal for students who wish to start new projects or who are already working on projects involving design, physical electronics, microprocessors (Arduino, Raspberry-PI, Beagle Bone, Galileo, PIC), laser-cutting, 3D-printing, and creative coding in Processing, Arduino, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, or Linux. All students will be expected to participate in hands-on learning, both in Workshops held in-class and as part of the course assignments and projects.
