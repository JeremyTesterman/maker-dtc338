# DTC 338, Spring 2015: “Maker Culture: Design at the Intersection of Material and Digital Practice” 

This course is an undergraduate-level hands-on introduction to Maker Culture. It is a makers’ workshop, a design lab, and a creative-programming studio, intended to provide a supporting framework for students’ research and development as they build ambitious projects of their own design.  This class will generate a shared research dialogue and space within which to pursue creative work that is conceptual and technical, and it is preeminently a place for students to ask questions, seek guidance and exchange ideas.  Course meetings will consist of a combination of roundtable discussions, reflective writing, group “critiques,” 5-minute presentations, design thinking exercises, and focused topic-and-tool-specific workshops.

## Required Materials 
* Regular and reliable access to the internet, email, and a computer for completing assignments.
* Flash drive (at least 1GB).
* Notebook or journal for in-class sketches, drawing, and response; also, pen or pencil.    

## Assignments 
To satisfy requirements of this course, students are expected to complete the following:  
* TWO PRESENTATIONS:  Medium/Slideshare/Prezi/Tumblr/Wordpress post and in-class quick presentation on select projects or concepts of “Maker Culture” 
* RESPONSE PAPERS: Wiki/classlist short written reflections or responses on topics of weekly interest 
* WORKSHOP CHALLENGES:  Workshop challenges (in-class design and building challenges) 
* TWO PROTOTYPES: Designing, documenting and building your own Maker Projects (Robot/Microcontroller, Wearable/IoT, 3D Printed/Digitally Fabricated) 
* ONE FINAL PROJECT: Creating a full “Instructables”-like How-To Demonstration for your own original Maker Project 

## Requirements and Assessment 
* Grades will be based on the following:
	* Roundtable Class Discussions and Class Participation (20%) 
	* Written Reflections and Response Papers (10%) 
	* Class Presentations (10%) , including Medium/Slideshare/Prezi/Tumblr/Wordpress post 
	* Workshop Prototypes (20%) 
	* Final Project (40%), Instructable or How-To Demonstration including Iterations and Prototypes, Product Narrative, Bill of Materials (BOM) Assessment, Design for Manufacture (DFM), Proof of Concept Model 

* Additionally, satisfying the requirements of this class means: 
	* All reading/video/audio assignments completed on time and as assigned. 
	* You are required to participate in the daily activities of our class — because we are learning in “workshop” mode, your presence in class, on time, every meeting is crucial. 
	* Independent research projects should be completed with originality and an effort made to share learning with the rest of the class. 
	* Students are expected to push themselves utilizing what is learned and what is already known in ways that are new, useful, and interesting to themselves, the class, and to the world.
